# END-TO-END-ML-MODELING-WITH-VISUALIZATION

Insurance Charges Analysis & Prediction
This project performs an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and builds a machine learning model to predict insurance charges based on various features like age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and geographic region. The work is structured in a Jupyter notebook that covers data visualization, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

Data Exploration & Visualization: Analyzes the dataset by loading and previewing the data, summarizing data types and statistics, and visualizing distributions. The focus includes key visualizations like histograms and box plots of distributions.
Modeling Approach: Involves creating a machine learning pipeline that preprocesses data (scaling numeric features and one-hot encoding categoricals) and trains a Gradient Boosting Regressor to predict insurance charges.
Deployment Ready: The trained pipeline is saved to disk and can be reloaded for new predictions with a one-call prediction function, which is also provided as a module.

Data Exploration & Visualization
The Jupyter notebook (VISUALIZATION-MODELING.ipynb) includes the following key sections:

Library Imports: Imports essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, plotly.express, and matplotlib.
Data Loading: Loads the dataset from data.csv and displays initial rows along with data type information.
Statistical Analysis: Provides descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and various percentiles for numeric columns.
Visualizations: Creates interactive visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots) using Plotly to analyze the age distribution and other feature distributions.
Key Findings: Summarizes main insights, such as the age distribution details and dataset dimensions, to inform further modeling efforts.
Modeling Approach
Preprocessing: The project uses a ColumnTransformer that scales numerical features (age, bmi, children) and one-hot encodes categorical features (sex, smoker, region).
Model Training: A Gradient Boosting Regressor is trained using the processed features.
Evaluation: Metrics like RMSE, and MAE are calculated for both training and testing sets.
The full data processing and modeling pipeline is encapsulated in a scikit-learn Pipeline for consistency and reproducibility.

Pipeline & Prediction Functions
Pipeline Saving/Reloading: The trained pipeline is serialized to insurance_charges_pipeline.joblib for later use.
One-Call Prediction Function: The project defines a single-call prediction function that accepts feature inputs and returns the predicted insurance charges. A module (insurance_predictor.py) is provided, making it easy to integrate predictions in other applications.

 # Example prediction  
 result = predict_insurance_charges(  
     age=30,  
     sex='male',  
     bmi=25.0,  
     children=0,  
     smoker='no',  
     region='northeast'  
 )  
 print('Predicted Insurance Charges:', result)  
Batch Prediction:

Use the batch prediction function for multiple entries:

 from insurance_predictor import batch_predict_insurance_charges  
 
 data_entries = [  
     {'age': 30, 'sex': 'male', 'bmi': 25.0, 'children': 0, 'smoker': 'no', 'region': 'northeast'},  
     {'age': 45, 'sex': 'female', 'bmi': 30.0, 'children': 2, 'smoker': 'yes', 'region': 'southwest'}  
 ]  
 predictions = batch_predict_insurance_charges(data_entries)  
 print('Batch Predictions:', predictions)
